# GRADE
#
# Given the score (0 to 100) received on a test, print the letter grade.
# You can just give the letter, no need for the +/-
#
# The score should be taken from user input.
#
# In case you have been at Hampshire long enough to forget how grades work,
# you can use the first table on this wikipedia page:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States
